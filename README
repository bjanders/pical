pical -- an iCalender to PCAL converter application

pical reads iCalender (.ics) files and converts them to PCAL
compatible files. pical does not make reoccurring events in PCAL, but
makes single date entries for a given time period as defined in the
source iCalender file. This is sufficent when you want to use another
calender app, but want to use the nice layout of PCAL.

PCAL can be found here: http://pcal.sourceforge.net/
